# Introduction

The project consists of a simple react app. The usual commands
`npm i` and `npm run dev` should get you up and running.

# Tasks
Update `App.tsx` and `App.css` with the following requirements:

- Convert the stateful React component in `App.tsx` to using hooks
- Format the date such that it will be shown in the specified timezone, formatted according to the user's browser's locale
- Apply these styling:
  - When the screen width is less than 600px, the time items (those with class name `"TimeItem"`) will be shown with full width distributed vertically
  - Otherwise, the time items will take up a third of the screen and distributed horizontally (i.e. only one row for all three time items)
- Refactor the code as you see fit


# Note
- Feel free to use any node packages and/or styling framework
- If you have any questions on the task, please make sensible assumptions and write your assumptions as comments in the code
